### Bio

Hello, my name is Adam Tovatt and I live in Stockholm, Sweden. I love trying to write the best possible code and I firmly believe that information and knowledge should be shared openly.

I embrace the notion that every goal is attainable; it's merely a matter of finding the right way to do it. I find like finding and refining these ways.

I am a self-taught developer, and prior to attending the Royal Institute of Technology, I worked as a back end/full stack developer for three years. I also co-founded the company Sakur AB alongside Oliver Levay.

I find interest in all things creative, and I am always looking for new ways to express myself. I enjoy programming, but I also like photography, playing the guitar, creating 3D graphics, and taking care of my plants in the best way possible. I am driven to innovate and create new things. I love designing both back-end architecture and front-end user experiences, as well as hardware systems. I sometimes like think of my self not as a developer, but rather as an artist. The world is my canvas and I live for my art.

### More information

If you want to get to know my coding better I suggest you read my code. I have a lot of public repositories and I've pinned the best ones on this profile page.
