### Bio

Hi, my name is Adam Tovatt and I live in Stockholm, Sweden. I have a passion for writing the best possible code and I firmly believe that information and knowledge should be shared openly. After all, information is created to be shared.

I embrace the notion that every goal is attainable; it's merely a matter of discovering the right path. I find immense satisfaction in uncovering and refining these pathways. I love witnessing the harmonious synchronization of intricate components in large-scale systems, akin to gears in a finely-crafted timepiece. Doing this while simultaneously making a positive impact on the world, leaving it a better place than it was when I first found it, gives me a sense of purpose.

When I was six years old, my dad showed me that if you save a text file with the file extension ".html", you can open it in a web browser and it will render as a web page. I was amazed, and that amazement still persists. There is no limit to how much you can learn, and my curiosity seems to have no bounds. I am a self-taught developer, and prior to attending the Royal Institute of Technology, I worked as a developer for three years and co-founded the company Sakur AB alongside Oliver Levay.

I find interest in all things creative, and I am always looking for new ways to express myself. I enjoy programming, but I also have a passion for photography, playing the guitar, creating 3D graphics, and taking care of my plants in the best way possible. I am driven to innovate and create new things. I love designing both back-end architecture and front-end user experiences, as well as hardware systems. I sometimes like think of my self not as a developer, but rather as an artist, and the world is my canvas. But don't tell anyone, I'm still worried it sounds a bit stupid.

I don't like to put labels on things and I also don't like the term "full stack developer" as it is often overused as a buzzword. But if you must, I suppose I can't deny that I possess the skills and knowledge typically associated with a full stack developer.

### Projects

If you want to get to know my coding better I suggest you read my code. I have a lot of public repositories and I've pinned the best ones on this profile page.

If you want to get to know me better personally I suggest you email me.
